# commonmark-lua

A pure Lua parsing expression grammar ([LPeg](http://www.inf.puc-rio.br/~roberto/lpeg/)) for [CommonMark](https://commonmark.org/).

## Related projects

Other Lua projects that directly target CommomMark include [cmark-lua](https://github.com/jgm/cmark-lua) and it's command line counterpart [lcmark](https://github.com/jgm/lcmark), as well as two more with *cmark* connections: [luacmark](https://github.com/jgm/luacmark) and [commonmark-lua](https://github.com/jgm/commonmark-lua)ยน.

Not directly targetting CommonMark but in some ways more similar to what this project aims to do are [peg-markdown](https://github.com/jgm/peg-markdown) and [lunamark](https://github.com/jgm/lunamark).

ยน <sub>Yes I am aware of the name conflict with this project, but it appears this early effort was abanded in favor of *cmark-lua* so I don't think the name conflict will be an issue.</sub>
